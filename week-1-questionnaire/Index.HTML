    <h1> Week 1 Questionnaire </h1>
<p>
1. Describe your previous experiences with coding.
 My previous experience with coding is what I le
 arned in Core 1 Interaction last semester, which is where 
 I was exposed to HTML, CSS, and JS. Learning about different libraries resonated with me, and I found Java Script confusing. 
</p>
<p>
2. How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in this 
class to help reduce this anxiety?   
I am excited about learning code so that I can understand how it works within my own work as a designer. 
I am also nervous, as coding is not something that comes naturally (as I learned last semeseter) and sometimes 
I understand a concept right away, and other times it takes more than a few explinations and walk throughs, so 
to reduce this anxiety I think patience is key.
</p>
<p>
3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college? 
I can imagine code fitting in with the rest of my design curriculum and my career after college as a tool that can help me make interaction a component of 
websites I would have previously overlooked.
</p>
<p>
4. What text editor do you prefer to use? 
Last semester we primarily used glitch for our projects, but I'm not sure if that would be considered a text editor or more of a website builder.
</p>
<p>
5. Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub. 
I have not used GitHub before, so I'm not quite sure what it is (other than the fact that I'm using it right now).
</p>
<p>
6. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this relationship. 
“Bonus points” for creative analogies. 
If HTML, CSS, and JS were a house, HTML would be the foundation and how the house is constructed. CSS would be the paint 
on the walls, interior decoration, pretty much what makes a home worth living in, because you wouldn't live in a house with 
no furniture, colour or sense of life (which CSS brings to websites) - at least I'd hope not. Now I'm not so sure about JS but 
I think it would be appliances, devices like TVs, electrical, and plumbing, which can be changed around to enhance the experience 
within a house. 
</p>
<p>
7. Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there’s 6 levels of heading tags).
<h1> 1. Sushi </h1>
<h2> 2. Fried Rice </h2>
<h3> 3. Miso Soup </h3>
<h4> 4. Pavlova </h4> 
<h5> 5. Creme Brule </h5>
<h6> 6. Empanadas </h6>
</p>
<p>
8. Create an unordered list and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites. 
    Include a paragraph on each site describing why it is important to you.
        <ul>
          <li> </li>
          <li> </li>  
          <li> </li>
        </ul>
</p>
<p>
9. Insert an image that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes alt text that describes the image.
<img src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDbaG4kqm6rHCIS-FuBypGypySAJrK76/view?usp=sharing" >
</p>
<p>
10. Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ac34Khe-fc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</p>
<p>
11. Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to 
maintain proper indentation. a. 
    <main> main →  
        <section> section → 
            <div> div → 
                <p> p → 
                    <span> span </span>
                </p>
            </div> 
        </section> 
    </main>
</p>
<p>
12. Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another ordered 
list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure you nest your 
ordered lists properly.
</p>
<p>
13. 13. Use pre tags to create a simple [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry) version of 
a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.
1. Hint: pre tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will show up like that 
when you view the web page.
</p>
<p>
14. Write an HTML comment that is hidden from the browser, but displays in the code.
</p>
<p>
15. Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item that 
matches the genre of music of that artist.
</p>
<p>
16. Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.
</p>
<p>
17. Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 9. Give each genre a color and personality using CSS.
</p>
<p>
18. Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).
</p>
<p>
19. In a script tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). Tell me something interesting about yourself.
</p>
