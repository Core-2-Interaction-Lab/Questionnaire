          Here’s my first setup! Looking back at it now, the top half is acceptable, but the bottom half is slightly concerning. Only after a little while did I learn that too many records stacked on top of each other can cause them to warp. I have an audio technica turntable, and she's in good working condition with a few scratches on the lid from Toby’s fingerboard, but it’s ok she's a beaut nonetheless.

  To some, my collection may seem small, and to others it may seem like a lot. Mind you, I have collected each of these individual records myself, except for the few my mum gave me. For something I will continue for however long I’m alive, I’ve got a good base amount of records, mostly classic rock, but that was my main interest in middle school and high school. My record collection isn’t really a reflection of my actual taste in music, just because my collection doesn’t grow and expand as fast as the rate that I listen to new music, but over time I’d like to round out my variety.

    Last summer I got this magazine rack antiquing with Mum, and thought it would be perfect for creating a stack of records to listen to. During high school I’d make a stack of records, almost like a playlist, so that I wouldn’t have to think about picking the next record. Now that my collection has gotten much larger, my box is full, so I have actually started storing records on the rack (which isn’t the best long term practice). Below you can find a mini collection that I have gathered of records and other delights.  </div>
