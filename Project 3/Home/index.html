    New York City has a rich history when it comes to public swimming pools. In the early 1900s, the city began building massive, ornate "natatoriums" to help residents cool off during the hot summer months. These grand pools featured everything from high dive platforms to artificial beaches and attracted thousands of swimmers each day. However, as the years went on, the city shifted away from these grand natatoriums and began building smaller, more neighborhood-centric pools. Today, New York City's public pool system is made up of three types of pools: outdoor, indoor, and mini pools. The city's outdoor pools, which can be found in parks across the five boroughs, are the most popular and are free to use. The indoor pools are typically found in recreation centers and require a membership or daily fee, while the mini pools are designed for children and can be found in some of the city's smaller parks. Despite the changes over the years, the public pool system remains an important resource for New Yorkers looking to beat the heat and enjoy some fun in the sun.

<div class="title">
  SINCE COVID
</div>
<div class="pt">
  Like many public spaces, New York City's public pools were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, all outdoor public pools were closed for the entire season, while indoor pools remained closed until late August. In 2021, however, the city was able to open its outdoor public pools with new health and safety measures in place. These measures include reduced capacity, mandatory face coverings, and enhanced cleaning and disinfection protocols. Additionally, all swimmers are required to follow social distancing guidelines, and locker rooms remain closed. While the experience of visiting a public pool may look a bit different now, the city is committed to providing a safe and enjoyable experience for all New Yorkers looking to take a refreshing swim during the hot summer months.
