            <ul>
                <li>1 slice of your choice of bread</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>1 tbsp of butter</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>

                <li> Gather your materials! Your ingredients include bread, eggs and butter. You should use a pan, spatula and your stovetop.</li>
                <li> Cut out a hole in the middle of your bread. It doesn't have to be perfect, just something to put your egg in.</li>
                <li> Butter your bread, creating a thin layer that covers the bread and the cutout intil the edges. Make sure to butter both sides!</li>
                <li> Heat up your pan and start frying your bread and cutout until golden on the first side.</li>
                <li> Flip both and crack your egg into the hole. Lower the heat to medium and let the egg cook until you can flip it over again.</li>
                <li> Set your fully done cutout on your plate and continue to flip your bread until you're satisfied with the colour and how well your egg is cooked.</li>
                <li> Season with salt and pepper, and any other spices of your choice. A little tomato sauce on the side never hurt anyone ;)</li>
                <li> Enjoy!</li>
