            <h1> Week 1 Questionnaire </h1>
          
    <body>
            
            
        <p> <pre> 
        
        
        1. Describe your previous experiences with coding.
        
        My previous experience with coding is what I learned in Core 1 Interaction last semester, which is where I was exposed to 
        HTML, CSS, and JS. Learning about different libraries resonated with me, and I found Java Script confusing. 
        </pre>
        </p>
        <p> <pre> 
        2. How excited about learning code are you? Are you nervous about learning code? If so, why? What can I do in this 
        class to help reduce this anxiety?   
        
        I am excited about learning code so that I can understand how it works within my own work as a designer. 
        I am also nervous, as coding is not something that comes naturally (as I learned last semeseter) and sometimes I understand 
        a concept right away, and other times it takes more than a few explinations and walk throughs, so to reduce this anxiety I 
        think patience is key.
        </pre> </p>
        <p><pre> 
        3. How do you imagine coding fitting in with the rest of your design curriculum and career after college?
        
        I can imagine code fitting in with the rest of my design curriculum and my career after college as a tool that can help me 
        make interaction a component of websites I would have previously overlooked.
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        4. What text editor do you prefer to use? 
        
        Last semester we primarily used glitch for our projects, but I'm not sure if that would be considered a text editor or more 
        of a website builder, but it is what I'm most comfortable with, and what I used for all of my work in Interaction last semester.
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        5. Have you used GitHub before? Do you know what it is? Describe your understanding of GitHub. 
        
        I have not used GitHub before, so I'm not quite sure what it is (other than the fact that I'm using it right now).
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        6. Describe the relationship between HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Try using a unique analogy to describe this relationship. 
        “Bonus points” for creative analogies. 
        
        If HTML, CSS, and JS were a house, HTML would be the foundation and how the house is constructed. CSS would be the paint 
        on the walls, interior decoration, pretty much what makes a home worth living in, because you wouldn't live in a house with 
        no furniture, colour or sense of life (which CSS brings to websites) - at least I'd hope not. Now I'm not so sure about JS but 
        I think it would be appliances, devices like TVs, electrical, and plumbing, which can be changed around to enhance the experience 
        within a house. 
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        7. Using each HTML heading tag, list your favorite foods ranked by importance (remember, there’s 6 levels of heading tags).
        
        <h1> 1. Sushi </h1>
        <h2> 2. Fried Rice </h2>
        <h3> 3. Miso Soup </h3>
        <h4> 4. Pavlova </h4> 
        <h5> 5. Creme Brule </h5>
        <h6> 6. Empanadas </h6>
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        8. Create an unordered list and link to some of your favorite graphic design or development related websites. 
            Include a paragraph on each site describing why it is important to you.
            
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://www.superlist.com" style="color: lightblue;">Superlist</a> 
               <ul>
                 <li> I’m interested in this website because of how much animations are embedded within the design of 
                 the interactive elements of this website. This is not only really engaging, but interesting and compelling. </li>
                  </ul></li>
                <li> <a href="https://swabtheworld.com/en/" style="color: lightblue;">Swabtheworld</a> 
               <ul>
                 <li> This website has a lot of interesting interactive, and non-interactive elements, so that pieces 
                 of the website are moving around even when the user is not interacting with them. I’m also drawn to how the 
                 visual simplicity creates a clean and streamlined aesthetic. </li>
                  </ul></li>  
                <li> <a href="https://spotify.design" style="color: lightblue;">spotifydesign</a> 
               <ul>
                 <li> I’m drawn to the colour, layout design, and type choices within this website as well as the way that 
                 the user can interact with menu items and other elements. I like how the information is easily accessible, 
                 as well as enjoyable to digest and read within the website. </li>
                  </ul></li>
              </ul>
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        9. Insert an image that brings you joy to the page. Make sure the image includes alt text that describes the image.
        <img src="IMG_7071.jpg" alt="Cosmo the glorious golden retreiver rolling around in the grass under the sun" width="500" height="500" >
        </pre></p>
        <p><pre> 
        10. Insert a video embed into the page (for example, a YouTube or Vimeo embed tag of a video of your choosing).
        
        <iframe width="560" 
                height="315" 
                src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ac34Khe-fc" 
                title="YouTube video player" 
                frameborder="0" 
                allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
                allowfullscreen>
        </iframe>
        </pre></p>
        <p> 
        11. Nest the following series of HTML tags inside each other, where each → represents a new level. Make sure to 
        maintain proper indentation. a. 
            <main> main →  
                <section> section →

        <p><pre> 
        12. Create an ordered list of the top 5 countries you’d like to visit. Within each country, create another ordered 
        list of the top cities you’d like to visit in that country. Maintain proper indentation and make sure you nest your 
        ordered lists properly.

        13. Use pre tags to create a simple [concrete poetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_poetry) version of 
        a Haiku or other poem you write. The poem should represent how you feel at this moment.
        1. Hint: pre tags respect whitespace, you can add add lots of spaces and line breaks and they will show up like that 
        when you view the web page.
           
        
                                                                        on

        15. Create an unordered list of at least 6 musical artists you like to listen to. Add a class to each list item that 
        matches the genre of music of that artist.
            <ul> 
                <div class= "rockpop"> <li> George Harrison </li> </div>
                <div class= "rock"> <li> Wings </li> </div>
                <div class= "psycadelicspacerock"> <li> Pink Floyd</li> </div>
                <div class= "glamrock"> <li> David Bowie </li> </div>
                <div class= "alternativerocknewwave"> <li> Crowded House </li> </div>
                <div class= "folk rock"> <li> Simon and Garfunkel </li> </div>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p> <pre> 
        16. Describe the difference between block, inline-block and inline elements.
        
        Within CSS, both inline and inline-block elements do not start on a new line, 
        although the width and height of inline elements cannot be set and will occupy 
        only the width it requires, while the width and height can be set within an inline-block element. 
        A block element can start on a new line, and similarly to inline-block elements, the width and height can also be set. 
        </pre></p>
        <p>
        17. Use CSS to style the musical genre classes you added in question 9. Give each genre a color and personality using CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
        18. Use any CSS knowledge you currently have to style your questionnaire in a unique way. Make sure to update the font to something other than the default (use the font-family css property).
        </p>
        <p>
        19. In a script tag, use the console.log function to write a message to the console (Cmd+Opt+U). Tell me something interesting about yourself.
            <script>
            console.log(“lover of starwars”);
            </script>    
        </p>
        <p>
        20. Add a button to your HTML file and make it do something when clicked using JavaScript.
        
           <button onclick="myFunc()">Click Me</button>
        
           <script>
              function myFunc(){
                 alert("You Clicked me");
              }
           </script>
          
        </p>
    </body>
        </div>
        
        <div id="container"></div>
        
        </html>
